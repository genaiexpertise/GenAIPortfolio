# RAG Apps with Streamlit
*** 
This repository contains a collection of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications deployed using Streamlit. RAG is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models, enabling the creation of more accurate and contextually relevant AI applications.


### Overview
This project is designed to demonstrate how to build and deploy RAG applications using Streamlit, a fast and easy-to-use framework for building data applications in Python. The repository includes various RAG-based applications that can be easily extended or customized for specific use cases.

### Features
- Streamlit Deployment: Quick and interactive deployment of RAG applications with a user-friendly interface.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Integration of retrieval mechanisms with generative models to enhance the quality of AI responses.
- Customizable Workflows: Modular code structure allowing for easy customization and extension of RAG workflows.
- Example Applications: Pre-built example applications demonstrating different use cases of RAG in real-world scenarios.


### Installation
To run these applications locally, follow the steps below:

- Clone the repository:
